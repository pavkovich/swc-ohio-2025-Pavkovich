Description: 
This is the Summer Working Connections Ohio 2025 - Credly Badge Criteria Project
There are 5 Items to complete and submit for a total grade of 100%.
This must achieve a minimum grade of 80%

The instructions are found on: https://github.com/FSCJ-FacultyDev/SWC_oHIo_2025 in the Assessment.ipynb file.

Note: Both professors are very knowledgeable and I would actually take a 16 week course with them and further increase my intelligence!
